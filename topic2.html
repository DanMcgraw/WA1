      <strong>Research in this field has been opening new doors for development. </strong>Since computers have been utilized, hardware engineers and software developers alike have been constructing components that beat their predecessors in
      performance and creating newer API's and libraries to utilize these hardware improvements. This is through research and what this research does is allows the developer to do more with what they have for the general purpose of their
      applications.
