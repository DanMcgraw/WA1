      <strong>The computer science industry has been achieving various landmarks for the recent history of it's existence. </strong>Since the dawn of the computer, researchers, specialists, and developers alike have been utilizing the construction
      of software to create mass amounts of data that is readable and interprettable by a computer. This data is compiled and rendered by an operating system to be interpretted into a function that is processed by the computer. People have used this
      method of calculating and projecting methods through automated tasks, running complex algorithms, displaying content and publicizing media.
