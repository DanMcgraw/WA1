      <strong>Applications have been fitted to adhere to the needs of the users. </strong>Applications developed on a computer are primarily used by an audience of users that are able to mitigate longer tasks and substitute them for shorter tasks,
      lowering the amount of time and effort needed to accomplish things. This results in cost savings, a lower amount of knowledge required for certain functions of application, and universal tools to help everyday people figure things out and have
      fun.
